	We have successfully completed 1,2,3,4,5,6

	The project should open fine on NetBeans.

	Passwords are md5 hashed on the client and then again on servlet.
	
	On the server side we have also complete 8 but there was
	not enough time to implement that on the front-end.

	On the front-end the developer was Olympia Xanthaki
	On the back-end the developer was Orfeas Kalipolitis

	The base code for a5 and codeSprint was from Orfeas Kalipolitis repo.

	This has been our show: "So in case we don't ever see you

	Good morning.
	Good afternoon.
	And good night.
